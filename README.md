As a term project for a Computer Vision Systems course I decided to implement a browser-based facial verification and identification system. The goal of this project was to provide an adaptive system capable of verifying registered users over multiple software and hardware platforms with limited requirements.

The code for this app is broken up into a front-end and back-end repository. The front-end code makes use of 
    *tensorflow.js libraries
    *face-api.js library
    *ReactJS Framework
    
While the backend uses the following and can be found at https://github.com/pseudobrilliant/Vision-Back-End
    *Heroku Web Services
    *MongoDB
    *Django REST Framework
